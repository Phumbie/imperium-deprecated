        <h4>2. FORMATION OF CONTRACT</h4>
        <p>
          Both parties agree that browsing the website and gathering information
          regarding the services provided by the seller does not constitute an
          offer to sell, but merely an invitation to treat. The parties accept

          to purchase, chosen your preferred payment method, proceeded to the
          checkout and completed the checkout process. Both parties agree that
          the acceptance of the offer is not made when the seller contacts you
          by phone or by email to confirm that the order has been placed online.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your offer is only accepted when we dispatch the product to you and
          inform you either by email or by phone of the dispatch of your ordered
          product. Before your order is confirmed, you may be asked to provide
          additional verifications or information, including but not limited to
          phone number and address, before we accept the order. Please note that
          there are cases when an order cannot be processed for various reasons.

          reason at any given time.

        <p>
          We are determined to provide the most accurate pricing information on
          the Site to our users; however, errors may occur, such as cases when
          the price of an item is not displayed correctly on the website. As
          such, we reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order. In the event
          that an item is mispriced, we may, at our own discretion, either
          contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of
          such cancellation. We shall have the right to refuse or cancel any
          such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and your
          credit/debit card charged.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the event that we are unable to provide the services, we will

          for any delay or failure to deliver the products within the estimated
          timescales where they did not occur due to our fault or negligence.
        </p>

        <p>
          You agree not to hold the seller liable for any delay or failure to
          deliver products or otherwise perform any obligation as specified in
